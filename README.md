Klingelball App (Bellball App)

Abstract
The "Bellball" is a ball for blind and visually impaired people. It has a bell inside so players can locate the ball. 
Although this ball is commonly used it has a few problems. For example, its sound is not very loud, it can't be customized and it stops when the ball stops moving. 

The "Digital Klingelball" aims to solve all those problems by replacing the physical bell with a speaker. In order to set the speaker to whatever sound players like the "Klingelball App" was created.
With it, players can set the tone and beeping frequency of the ball, as well as the brightness and colour of the LEDs so visually impaired players can better locate the ball. 

This project was done in cooperation with the "Department of Sport and Human Movement Science" at the university of Vienna as a diploma thesis at "HTL 3 Rennweg".
